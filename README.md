# rs3713615-Investigation
Scripts used in rs3173615 analysis for AS.410.635. The script takes an input file of the genotype counts of the snp in the 1000G Project Phase 3 data. The VCF was pulled from the FTP site. It was filtered for rs3173615, and the genotype data for the SNP was pulled for each sample. This was overalapped with the population metadata from 1000G and counts of each genotype for each population were recorded in the file. The input file was formatted as a TSV with columns 'Population', 'rs3173615.Genotype', and 'Freq'. The final output for the script is the chisq results of the genotype counts for African vs Non-African samples.
